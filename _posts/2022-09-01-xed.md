I've been using this command for a while, but realize not everyone might know it.  

`xed` the Xcode text editor invocation tool.  
It let's you open, create and handle Xcode related files in many ways, but the one that I predominantely use is:

```terminal
$ xed .
```

When executed inside a folder with Xcode related files, it will open the "largest" Xcode document it finds.  
Meaning, it will open the first `*.xcworkspace`, `*.xcodeproj` or `Package.swift` it can find, in this order of preference.

If you're in a folder with a `xcodeproj` file, but no workspace, it will open the project. If the folder only contains a `Package.swift`, it will open the package. Generally, this will open the appropriate file for the folder of the project you're working on.
