I've been using zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) for the longest time because of its functionality, 
vast plugin eco-system, and quite frankly, the time I had sunk into customizing it to my needs.

## Basics

The fish equivalent for `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` is `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

## Abbreviations, Aliases and Functions

- [Abbreviations](https://fishshell.com/docs/2.7/commands.html#abbr) will simply expand a short text into something longer after pressing space or enter.  
- [Functions](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/function.html) are written in `.fish` files and saved under `~/.config/fish/functions`.
- [Aliases](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/alias.html) can be defined via your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file.

The problem here, with a bash alias I was able to type `which someAlias` to see what the alias expanded into.  
In fish, the `which` command doesn't work that way for aliases.  

In the documentation, it says that `alias` is a convenience wrapper for `function`. 
It will create a function that simply  With the added benefit of automatically creating a description stating what the command expands into.

For example: 

```fish
alias lsa="ls -la"
```
will create a fish function with a description of `alias lsa=ls -la`. 

Which you can see by listing command completions via `tab`:

## Prompt

There are lots of ways to customize the prompt in fish, even within fish itself.
I've settled with [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) for now. It's written in Rust and very customizable, fast, and usable with many different shells. Not only fish.

> Judging by the name and general appearance, starship seems to be inspired by [spaceship](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt) prompt for zsh.

Here's what my current prompt looks like:

I'm using [exa](https://the.exa.website) as a `ls` replacement.  
The `LS_COLORS` settings are generated by [vivid](https://github.com/sharkdp/vivid).

The prompt itself shows the current path abbreviated up to the parent directory, the current branch name and status if the current directory is managed by git, followed by language environment information. Here it shows that the local Ruby version (managed by rbenv) for my Jekyll blog, is `3.0.`.
