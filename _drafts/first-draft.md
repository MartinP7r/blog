# First Post with Jekyll

Hi there,  

I decided to move to Jekyll as a framework for my tech blog, which I did for several reasons.

Wordpress is great and has lots of features but can feel a little heavy at times. I might have to invest a little more time into the setup, but Jekyll seems to give me way more control.

Another point is that I don't have too much experience with Ruby and this gives me some opportunity to play around with it.

Most importantly, Jekyll let's me quickly write up a post in markdown and I can publish it by just moving it to the right folder and push to my repository which is hosted on netlify.

I will be migrating my first couple of posts from my wordpress blog over here.

## So here are some visual tests

- A 
- List 
  - with
  - some
  - items
- and more

| A    | Table       | with    |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| some | interesting | content |
| and  | some        | more    |
| and  | then        | some    |


```swift
// Some piece of code
func hoge(a: String) -> Int? {
  return nil
}
```

and some `inline code` highlighting.
