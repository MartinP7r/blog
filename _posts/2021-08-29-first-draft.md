# First Post

Hi there,

this is more a repost than a post, but since I haven't done much with the previous version of this blog, I think it still counts. ðŸ˜…

I've decided to start writing more about the things that I jot down while learning about new technologies and API and while developing my pet projects.  

For one, this hopefully helps me to improve on my technical English writing skill.  

And also, writing a somewhat understandable blog post requires me to think more deeply about the matter at hand, improving my understanding and retention of the material. Hopefully.

## Migrating to Jekyll

I decided to move to Jekyll as a framework for my tech blog for several reasons.

Wordpress is great and has lots of features but can feel a little heavy at times. I might have to invest a little more time into the setup, but Jekyll seems to give me way more control.

Another point is that I don't have too much experience with Ruby, and this gives me some opportunity to play around with it.

Now I'm able to quickly write up a post in markdown, and I can publish it by just moving it to the appropriate folder and push to the repository hosted on Netlify.

I will be migrating my first couple of posts from my Wordpress blog over here.

## So here are some visual tests

Just to check and see if I broke anything while tweaking the theme... ðŸ˜…

- A 
- List 
  - with
  - some
  - items
- and more

| A    | Table       | with    |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| some | interesting | content |
| and  | some        | more    |
| and  | then        | some    |

```
Some text in code
block
```

```swift
// Some piece of code in Swift syntax highlighted
func hoge(a: String) -> Int? {
  return nil
}
```

and some `inline code` highlighting.
